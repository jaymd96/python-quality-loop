# GitOps Workflow

Structured Git operations integrated with the Manager-Doer development workflow. Ensures clean history, isolated development, and proper code review.

## Quick Reference

### Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout -b feature/module-name main
```

### Conventional Commit
```bash
git commit -m "feat(module): add core functionality"
```

### Create PR
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat(module): description" --body "## Summary\n..."
```

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use GitOps workflow when:
- Starting a new module development (Phase 0)
- Making progress commits during development (Phase 1)
- Cleaning up history before review (Phase 2)
- Creating pull requests for merge (Phase 3)
- Cleaning up after successful merge

---

## Branch Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/{module-name}      # New feature development
fix/{issue-description}    # Bug fixes
refactor/{component}       # Code improvements
docs/{topic}               # Documentation updates
```

### Examples

```bash
feature/dependency-graph
fix/auth-token-expiry
refactor/catalog-resolver
docs/api-reference
```

### Rules

1. Use lowercase with hyphens
2. Be descriptive but concise
3. Match the module or issue being worked on
4. Delete after merge

---

## Worktree Management

### When to Use Worktrees

- Parallel development of multiple modules
- Keeping main branch accessible while working
- Context switching without stashing

### Create Worktree

```bash
# Create branch and worktree together
git worktree add ../project-module-name -b feature/module-name

# Or for existing branch
git worktree add ../project-module-name feature/module-name
```

### List Worktrees

```bash
git worktree list
```

### Remove Worktree

After merge:
```bash
git worktree remove ../project-module-name
```

### Best Practices

1. **Naming**: Use `project-module-name` format for worktree directories
2. **Location**: Place worktrees adjacent to main repo (`../`)
3. **Cleanup**: Always remove worktrees after merge
4. **Branch deletion**: Delete branch after worktree removal

---

## Conventional Commits

### Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature | `feat(catalog): add dependency resolver` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(auth): handle expired tokens` |
| `refactor` | Code change (no new feature) | `refactor(api): simplify route handlers` |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests | `test(catalog): add edge case coverage` |
| `docs` | Documentation | `docs(readme): add installation guide` |
| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore(deps): update dependencies` |
| `style` | Formatting (no code change) | `style(lint): fix whitespace` |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | `perf(query): optimize batch loading` |

### Scope

The scope should match the module or component being changed:
- `(catalog)` - Catalog module
- `(auth)` - Authentication
- `(api)` - API routes
- `(cli)` - Command line interface

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(catalog): add version resolution with semver support"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(auth): prevent token refresh race condition"

# Refactor
git commit -m "refactor(catalog): extract dependency graph to separate module"

# Test
git commit -m "test(catalog): add tests for circular dependency detection"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(api): document new /versions endpoint"

# With body
git commit -m "feat(catalog): add module promotion workflow

Implements the promotion workflow for moving modules between
release channels. Includes validation gates and rollback support.

Closes #123"
```

### Co-Authored Commits

When working with AI assistance:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(module): description

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

## Phase Integration

### Phase 0: Discovery

**Setup branch and tracking**

```bash
# Ensure main is up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/module-name

# Initial commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore(module-name): initialize development"

# Push branch
git push -u origin feature/module-name
```

**If using worktree**:
```bash
git worktree add ../project-module-name -b feature/module-name
cd ../project-module-name
git push -u origin feature/module-name
```

### Phase 1: Development

**Commit per development step**

```bash
# After Step 1 (Implementation)
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(module): implement core functionality"

# After Step 3 (Standards)
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor(module): apply zen-of-python improvements"

# After Step 4 (Review)
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(module): address code review findings"

# After Step 6 (Testing)
git add -A
git commit -m "test(module): add pytest coverage"
```

**Commit frequency options**:

| Strategy | When | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| Per step | Long iterations | 6 commits per iteration |
| Per iteration | Short iterations | 1 commit with all changes |
| Logical units | Normal | 2-3 commits per iteration |

### Phase 2: Refinement

**After ITERATE feedback**

```bash
# Fix specific issues
git add -A
git commit -m "fix(module): address iteration N feedback

- Fixed edge case in validate_input()
- Added missing error handling
- Improved docstring clarity"
```

**Optional: Squash commits**

```bash
# Interactive rebase to squash (if history is messy)
git rebase -i main

# Or squash last N commits
git reset --soft HEAD~N
git commit -m "feat(module): consolidated implementation"
```

### Phase 3: Completion

**Final documentation commit**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "docs(module): complete documentation and examples"
```

**Create pull request**

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(module-name): Brief description" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

## Common Operations

### Sync with Main

```bash
# Rebase onto main (preferred)
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# Or merge (if rebasing causes issues)
git merge origin/main
```

### Fix Last Commit

```bash
# Amend message
git commit --amend -m "new message"

# Add forgotten files
git add forgotten-file.py
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

### Undo Last Commit (keep changes)

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### View Branch Status

```bash
# See commits ahead of main
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# See files changed
git diff --stat main
```

### Stash Work in Progress

```bash
# Stash with message
git stash push -m "WIP: description"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply and remove
git stash pop
```

---

## Merge Strategies

### Squash Merge (Default)

All commits combined into one. Best for:
- Feature branches with messy history
- Small features
- Standard workflow

```bash
gh pr merge --squash
```

### Rebase Merge

Commits replayed on main. Best for:
- Clean, logical commit history
- When individual commits are meaningful

```bash
gh pr merge --rebase
```

### Merge Commit

Creates merge commit. Best for:
- Long-running branches
- When branch history matters

```bash
gh pr merge --merge
```

### Recommendation

Use **squash merge** by default. The PR itself serves as the historical record.

---

## Error Recovery

### Accidental Commit to Main

```bash
# Create branch with the commit
git branch feature/accidental-work

# Reset main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### Merge Conflict

```bash
# During rebase
git rebase origin/main
# [resolve conflicts]
git add resolved-file.py
git rebase --continue

# Abort if needed
git rebase --abort
```

### Lost Commits

```bash
# Find lost commits
git reflog

# Recover specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

---

| Phase 3 | Create PR, merge, cleanup |

**Key Principles**:
1. One branch per module
